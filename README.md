# Hierarchical-clustering-project
# Project title:
Analysis and prediction of "mall_customer.csv" of American mall market called as phonix mall, find out on basic of clients requirments of dendrogram using scipy graphic library with the help of "scipy.cluster.hierarchy",to ace the no of linkage of the clustering to predict.

# Problem statement:
The american finance market clients as per the rate of gdp of 2011 found as higest no of growth in the business market.

AS a data science engineerfind out which hierarchy clusteer give maximum linkage in up comming future

# TASK 1
with the help of spicy library import the library and import datasets

# TASK 2
Using the dendrogram to find optimal no of clusters

# TASK 3
Create a hierarchy model and visualize the cluster with the help of matplot library

# Project apprach

# Conclusion
According to the model building as a engineer may prediction is cluster-3 has give highest no of linkage
